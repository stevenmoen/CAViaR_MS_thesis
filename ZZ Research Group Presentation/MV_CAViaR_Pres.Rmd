## Roadmap

* Background: Summarize M.S. thesis
* Describe extensions and get feedback:
    + Extension 1: Improve forecast from thesis
    + Extension 2: Combine predictions between models
    + Extension 3: Build predictive algorithm, from PCA
    
## Executive Summary

* I developed a new risk prediction model that is easy to interpret but needs help with predictive accuracy.
* I also developed two potentially novel but unproven extensions based on this model that may need a better application.

## Background: What to forecast?

* What should we predict in equity returns?
* The S&P 500 (largest 500 U.S. stocks) earned ~6.8% pre-tax, post-inflation from 1871-2020
    + Includes world wars, great depression, stagflation
    + ``In the long run we are all dead"
* Short-term gyrations drive long-term performance 

## Background: How to forecast?

* Fully generative vs. fully nonparametric
    + Fully generative (RiskMetrics)
    + Fully nonparametric (historical simulation)

## Background: Value-at-Risk

- 1% VaR of -\$10MM = lose \$10MM+ 1 out of 100 days
    + Boils risk into ``one number"
    + Commonly used by financial regulators

## Background: What is CAViaR?

- CAViaR = conditional autoregressive value at risk
    + Developed by Engle and Manganelli in 2004
- Directly predicts $\alpha$ % quantile
    + Balances between too little and too much
- Statistically robust
    + Builds upon rich methodology literature

## Background: Potential Issues with CAViaR?

- How to incorporate information from other stocks?
- How can we have clear, explainable results?

## Background: Proposed Extensions as "Multivariate CAViaR"

- Include meaningful ETFs (exchange traded funds)
    + ETFs avoid issues like bankruptcy & mergers
- I used mostly sector ETFs (utilities, industrial, energy, etc.)
- I used SPY (S&P 500 ETF) as a response

## Background: Proposed Extensions as "Multivariate CAViaR"

- Idea: Combine ETFs into principal components at forecast origin (diffusion indices, or DIs)
    + Builds upon the diffusion index literature from Stock and Watson in 2002
- Add nonlinear autoregressive (AR) terms from SPY into model
- 4 configurations of univariate model 
- 4 configurations of multivariate model 

## Background: Fitting Process

- Take 5 years of SPY returns
    + ~3 years: Training set
    + ~1 year: Validation set
    + ~1 year: Test set
- Choose number of DIs & AR lags on validation set
- Evaluate performance of 1%, 5%, and 10% VaR
- Evaluate in 2008, 2010, 2014, and 2016

## Background: Results

- Results from 2008 were poor
- Results were comparable in 2010, 2014, and 2016

## Extension 1

- How to improve this forecast?

- One idea: Include MA terms in MV CAViaR
    + Pro: Likely dramatically improves accuracy
    + Con: Harder to interpret model
    + Cons: Harder to fit model

## Extension 2: A Tale of Two Approaches

1. ``Rational" forecast
    + Day of week, weather, time, etc.
2. ``Irrational" forecast
    + Anchor to recent behavior

## Extension 2: Application to Earlier Work

- When multivariate CAViaR dominates, we're in a ``rational" state
- Otherwise, in a ``irrational" state
- Find posterior probability of latent state using Hidden Markov Model
-- Some details omitted (see appendix)

## Extension 2: Application to Earlier Work

- Results are not overly promising, but may require another dataset

## Extension 3: Motivation from PCA

## Extension 3: Calculating Resultants

## Extension 3: Procedure

- Compute the resultant for $t$ points and $m$ vectors
- Measure the angle between resultants; 90 degrees implies "orthogonal"
- Results are promising
